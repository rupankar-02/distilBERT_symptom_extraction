"Signs and symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency are similar to those of menopause or estrogen deficiency. They include:  Irregular or skipped periods, which might be present for years or develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills Difficulty getting pregnant Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness Dry eyes Irritability or difficulty concentrating Decreased sexual desire  When to see a health care provider If you've missed your period for three months or more, see your health care provider to determine the cause. You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your provider to find out what's causing the change. Low estrogen levels can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of heart disease.","['signs symptoms primary ovarian insufficiency similar menopause estrogen deficiency', ' include:  irregular skipped periods', "" present years develop pregnancy stopping birth control pills difficulty pregnant hot flashes night sweats vaginal dryness dry eyes irritability difficulty concentrating decreased sexual desire  see health care provider you've missed period months more"", ' see health care provider determine cause', ' can miss period number reasons — including pregnancy', ' stress', "" change diet exercise habits — it's best evaluated menstrual cycle changes"", "" don't mind periods"", "" it's advisable see provider find what's causing change"", ' low estrogen levels can lead bone loss increased risk heart disease']"

"Posterior cortical atrophy symptoms vary among people. Symptoms also can vary over time. They tend to gradually get worse. Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition.

"An unusual sensation (aura) may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras, and not everyone who has auras remembers them. The aura is actually the first part of a focal seizure before consciousness is impaired. Examples of auras include:  A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before A sudden or strange odor or taste A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster  Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:  Loss of awareness of surroundings Staring Lip smacking Repeated swallowing or chewing Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions  After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:  A period of confusion and difficulty speaking Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure Unawareness of having had a seizure Extreme sleepiness  In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.","['unusual sensation (aura) may precede temporal lobe seizure', ' acting warning', ' who temporal lobe seizures auras', ' who auras remembers them', ' aura actually first part focal seizure consciousness impaired', "" examples auras include:  sudden sense unprovoked fear joy deja vu experience — feeling what's happening happened sudden strange odor taste rising sensation abdomen"", ' similar being roller coaster  temporal lobe seizures impair ability respond others', ' type temporal lobe seizure lasts 30 seconds minutes', ' characteristic signs symptoms include:  loss awareness surroundings staring lip smacking repeated swallowing chewing unusual finger movements', ' picking motions  temporal lobe seizure', ' may have:  period confusion difficulty speaking inability recall occurred seizure unawareness seizure extreme sleepiness  extreme cases', ' starts temporal lobe seizure evolves generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions loss consciousness']"

During your child's first year, the red mark grows rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin.

"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) affects many parts of your body. Symptoms usually start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms you have when you're diagnosed. MSA Parkinsonian type This is the most common type of MSA. The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease, such as: MSA  Stiff muscles Difficulty bending your arms and legs Slow movement (bradykinesia) Tremors can occur at rest or when moving your arms or legs Soft voice Problems with posture and balance  Cerebellar type The main signs and symptoms are problems with muscle coordination (ataxia), but others may include:  Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance Slurred, slow or low-volume speech (dysarthria) Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing Changes in speech, such as slurred speech   General signs and symptoms In addition, the primary sign of multiple system atrophy is autonomic failure, which may cause problems with body functions you can't control. This may include: Postural (orthostatic) hypotension Postural hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even faint, when you stand up from sitting or lying down. Not everyone with MSA has postural hypotension. MSA You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down (supine hypertension). Urinary and bowel dysfunction  Constipation Loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence)  Changes in sweat production  Producing less sweat Heat intolerance due to reduced sweating Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet  Sleep disorders  Agitated sleep due to ""acting out"" dreams Abnormal breathing at night or a harsh breathing sound (stridor)  Sexual dysfunction  Inability to achieve or maintain an erection (impotence) Loss of libido  Cardiovascular problems  Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood  Psychiatric problems  Difficulty controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying inappropriately","['multiple system atrophy (msa) affects parts body', ' symptoms start adulthood', ' 50s 60s', ' types msa: parkinsonian cerebellar', "" type depends symptoms you're diagnosed"", ' msa parkinsonian type common type msa', "" signs symptoms similar parkinson's disease"", ' as: msa  stiff muscles difficulty bending arms legs slow movement (bradykinesia) tremors can occur rest moving arms legs soft voice problems posture balance  cerebellar type signs symptoms problems muscle coordination (ataxia)', ' may include:  impaired movement coordination', ' unsteady gait loss balance slurred', ' slow low-volume speech (dysarthria) visual disturbances', ' blurred double vision difficulty focusing eyes difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) chewing changes speech', ' slurred speech   general signs symptoms addition', ' primary sign multiple system atrophy autonomic failure', "" may cause problems body functions can't control"", ' may include: postural (orthostatic) hypotension postural hypotension form low blood pressure makes feel dizzy lightheaded', ' faint', ' stand sitting lying down', ' msa postural hypotension', ' msa can develop dangerously high blood pressure levels lying down (supine hypertension)', ' urinary bowel dysfunction  constipation loss bladder bowel control (incontinence)  changes sweat production  producing sweat heat intolerance due reduced sweating impaired body temperature control', ' causing cold hands feet  sleep disorders  agitated sleep due ""acting out"" dreams abnormal breathing night harsh breathing sound (stridor)  sexual dysfunction  inability achieve maintain erection (impotence) loss libido  cardiovascular problems  color changes hands feet caused pooling blood  psychiatric problems  difficulty controlling emotions', ' laughing crying inappropriately ']"

"A popliteal artery aneurysm may not cause any noticeable symptoms. The first symptom may be pain the lower leg that occurs with walking (claudication). Other signs and symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include:   Knee pain Lower leg pain Swelling behind the knee Pulsing sensation behind the knee  Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including:  Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) High blood pressure Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repetitive use of the knee joint Weakening of the artery wall  Risk factors Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. They are more common in men than in women. Popiteal artery aneurysms often occur in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery (aorta). Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA. AAA Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include:  Increasing age High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Narrowing of a heart valve (stenotic disease) Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body  Complications Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots (thrombosis) and, rarely, rupture of the aneurysm. Thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm can cause a severe lack of blood flow (ischemia) in the lower leg, which may result in loss of the limb. Sudden leg ischemia can cause the following signs and symptoms:  A change in skin color in the affected area No pulse behind the knee Skin in the affected area feels cold Numbness in the leg Inability to move the foot  The risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low. Prevention Smoking and high blood pressure (hypertension) increase the risk of blood vessel (vascular) problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle — such as not smoking, eating a nutritious diet and getting regular exercise — can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage.

"The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life. Physical defects Physical defects may include:  Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers Slow physical growth before and after birth Vision difficulties or hearing problems Small head circumference and brain size Heart defects and problems with kidneys and bones  Brain and central nervous system problemsProblems with the brain and central nervous system may include:  Poor coordination or balance Intellectual disability, learning disorders and delayed development Poor memory Trouble with attention and with processing information Difficulty with reasoning and problem-solving Difficulty identifying consequences of choices Poor judgment skills Jitteriness or hyperactivity Rapidly changing moods  Social and behavioral issuesProblems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include:  Difficulty in school Trouble getting along with others Poor social skills Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another Problems with behavior and impulse control Poor concept of time Problems staying on task Difficulty planning or working toward a goal  When to see a doctorIf you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help. Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help. If you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant — and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.

This is the most common form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, starting around 2 years of age or younger. Progressive loss of speech and muscle function occurs rapidly. Children with this form often do not survive beyond childhood. Juvenile form. This is the second most common form and starts in children between 3 and 16 years of age. Early signs are behavior and cognitive problems and increasing difficulty in school. Loss of the ability to walk may occur. Although the juvenile form doesn't progress as fast as the late infantile form, survival is generally less than 20 years after symptoms begin. Adult form. This form is less common and typically starts after age 16. Signs progress slowly and may begin with behavior and psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol misuse, and issues with school and work. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may occur. The course of this form varies, with periods of stable symptoms and periods of rapid decline in functioning. Adults may survive for several decades after initial symptoms.","['damage protective myelin covering nerves results progressive worsening brain nervous system functions', ' including:  loss ability detect sensations', ' touch', ' pain', ' heat sound loss intellectual', ' thinking memory skills loss motor skills', ' walking', ' moving', ' speaking swallowing stiff', ' rigid muscles', ' poor muscle function paralysis loss bladder bowel function gallbladder problems blindness hearing loss seizures emotional behavioral problems', ' including unstable emotions substance misuse  form metachromatic leukodystrophy occurs age can initial signs symptoms rates progression:  late infantile form', ' common form metachromatic leukodystrophy', ' starting 2 years age younger', ' progressive loss speech muscle function occurs rapidly', ' children form survive childhood', ' juvenile form', ' second common form starts children 3 16 years age', ' early signs behavior cognitive problems increasing difficulty school', ' loss ability walk may occur', "" juvenile form doesn't progress fast late infantile form"", ' survival generally 20 years symptoms begin', ' adult form', ' form common typically starts age 16', ' signs progress slowly may begin behavior psychiatric problems', ' drug alcohol misuse', ' issues school work', ' psychotic symptoms delusions hallucinations may occur', ' course form varies', ' periods stable symptoms periods rapid decline functioning', ' adults may survive decades initial symptoms', ' ']"

"There are different types of Gaucher disease, and signs and symptoms of disease vary widely, even within the same type. Type 1 is by far the most common. Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity. Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms. Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems:  Abdominal complaints. Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended. Skeletal abnormalities. Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds.  More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.","['types gaucher disease', ' signs symptoms disease vary widely', ' type', ' type 1 far common', ' siblings', ' identical twins', ' disease can levels severity', ' people who gaucher disease only mild symptoms', ' people who gaucher disease varying degrees following problems:  abdominal complaints', ' liver especially spleen can enlarge dramatically', ' abdomen can painfully distended', ' skeletal abnormalities', ' gaucher disease can weaken bone', ' increasing risk painful fractures', ' can interfere blood supply bones', ' can cause portions bone die', ' blood disorders', ' decrease healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result severe fatigue', ' gaucher disease affects cells responsible clotting', ' can cause easy bruising nosebleeds', '  rarely', ' gaucher disease affects brain', ' can cause abnormal eye movements', ' muscle rigidity', ' swallowing difficulties seizures', ' rare subtype gaucher disease begins infancy typically results death 2 years age']"

"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the signs and symptoms of CF show up. CF Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. CF Respiratory signs and symptoms The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as:  A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) Wheezing Exercise intolerance Repeated lung infections Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose Recurrent sinusitis  Digestive signs and symptoms The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often:  Foul-smelling, greasy stools Poor weight gain and growth Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus) Chronic or severe constipation, which may include frequent straining while trying to pass stool, eventually causing part of the rectum to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse)","['u', 's', ' newborn screening', ' cystic fibrosis can diagnosed first month life', ' symptoms develop', ' people born newborn screening may diagnosed signs symptoms cf show up', ' cf cystic fibrosis signs symptoms vary', ' depending severity disease', ' person', ' symptoms may worsen improve time passes', ' people may experience symptoms teenage years adulthood', ' people who diagnosed adulthood milder disease likely atypical symptoms', ' recurring bouts inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)', ' infertility recurring pneumonia', ' people cystic fibrosis higher normal level salt sweat', ' parents can taste salt kiss children', ' signs symptoms cf affect respiratory system digestive system', ' cf respiratory signs symptoms thick sticky mucus associated cystic fibrosis clogs tubes carry air lungs', ' can cause signs symptoms as:  persistent cough produces thick mucus (sputum) wheezing exercise intolerance repeated lung infections inflamed nasal passages stuffy nose recurrent sinusitis  digestive signs symptoms thick mucus can block tubes carry digestive enzymes pancreas small intestine', ' digestive enzymes', "" intestines aren't able completely absorb nutrients food eat"", ' result often:  foul-smelling', ' greasy stools poor weight gain growth intestinal blockage', ' newborns (meconium ileus) chronic severe constipation', ' may include frequent straining trying pass stool', ' eventually causing part rectum protrude anus (rectal prolapse) ']"

Almost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood.

Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include severe pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and blood in your urine. A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder. If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful.

"Behcet's disease symptoms vary from person to person, can come and go or become less severe over time. Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected. Areas commonly affected by Behcet's disease include:  Mouth. Painful mouth sores that look similar to canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet's disease. They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers. The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur. Skin. Some people develop acnelike sores on their bodies. Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs. Genitals. Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are usually painful and can leave scars. Eyes. Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go. Joints. Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own. Blood vessels. Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. Digestive system. A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding. Brain. Inflammation in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance or stroke.","[""behcet's disease symptoms vary person person"", ' can come severe time', ' signs symptoms depend parts body affected', "" areas commonly affected behcet's disease include:  mouth"", "" painful mouth sores look similar canker sores common sign behcet's disease"", ' begin raised', ' round lesions mouth quickly turn painful ulcers', ' sores heal weeks', ' recur', ' skin', ' people develop acnelike sores bodies', ' develop red', ' raised tender nodules skin', ' especially lower legs', ' genitals', ' red', ' open sores can occur scrotum vulva', ' sores painful can leave scars', ' eyes', ' inflammation eye (uveitis) causes redness', ' pain blurred vision', ' typically eyes', "" people behcet's disease"", ' condition can come go', ' joints', "" joint swelling pain affect knees people behcet's disease"", ' ankles', ' elbows wrists involved', ' signs symptoms can last weeks away own', ' blood vessels', ' inflammation veins arteries can cause redness', ' pain', ' swelling arms legs blood clot results', ' inflammation large arteries can lead complications', ' aneurysms narrowing blockage vessel', ' digestive system', ' variety signs symptoms can affect digestive system', ' including abdominal pain', ' diarrhea bleeding', ' brain', ' inflammation brain nervous system can cause headache', ' fever', ' disorientation', ' poor balance stroke', ' ']"

"An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:  Sudden stop in motion without falling Lip smacking Eyelid flutters Chewing motions Finger rubbing Small movements of both hands  Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming.

Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops. Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with:  Female genitals Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals) Underdeveloped male genitals  Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper:  Development of muscle mass Voice deepening Growth of body and facial hair Growth of the penis and testicles  And it can cause:  Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)  Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include:  Decreased sex drive Decreased energy Depression  Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop:  Erectile dysfunction Infertility Decrease in hair growth on the face and body Decrease in muscle mass Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)  Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include:  Difficulty concentrating Hot flashes  When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism. Finding the cause of hypogonadism is an important first step to getting appropriate treatment.","['           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '               male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '        close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '     close    close  close male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '  male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' hypogonadism can begin fetal development', ' puberty adulthood', ' signs symptoms depend condition develops', "" fetal development body doesn't produce testosterone fetal development"", ' result may impaired growth external sex organs', ' depending hypogonadism develops testosterone present', ' child who genetically male may born with:  female genitals genitals clearly male clearly female (ambiguous genitals) underdeveloped male genitals  puberty male hypogonadism can delay puberty cause incomplete lack normal development', ' can hamper:  development muscle mass voice deepening growth body facial hair growth penis testicles  can cause:  excessive growth arms legs relation trunk body development breast tissue (gynecomastia)  adulthood adult males', ' hypogonadism can alter masculine physical characteristics impair normal reproductive function', ' early signs symptoms include:  decreased sex drive decreased energy depression  time', ' men hypogonadism can develop:  erectile dysfunction infertility decrease hair growth face body decrease muscle mass development breast tissue (gynecomastia) loss bone mass (osteoporosis)  severe hypogonadism can cause mental emotional changes', ' testosterone decreases', ' men symptoms similar menopause women', ' can include:  difficulty concentrating hot flashes  seek help see health care provider symptoms male hypogonadism', ' finding cause hypogonadism important first step treatment']"

"Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages. Prodrome One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:  Constipation Mood changes, from depression to euphoria Food cravings Neck stiffness Increased urination Fluid retention Frequent yawning  Aura For some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes.

"Your baby may have very mild symptoms of premature birth or more-serious health problems. Some signs of being born too early include:  Small size, with a head that's large compared with the body.  Features that are sharper and less rounded than a full-term baby's features due to a lack of cells that store fat.  Fine hair that covers much of the body. Low body temperature, mainly right after birth in the delivery room. Trouble breathing. Feeding problems.

(21 cm) Special care If you give birth to a preterm baby, your baby will likely need to stay in a special nursery unit at the hospital. Some infants need to spend time in a unit that cares for them and closely tracks their health day and night. This is called a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A step down from the NICU is an intermediate care nursery, which provides less intensive care. Special nursery units are staffed with health care providers and a team that's trained to help preterm babies. NICU Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery. Your health care team can help you understand what's needed and what your baby's care plan will be. Feel free to ask them questions.","['baby may mild symptoms premature birth more-serious health problems', ' signs being born early include:  small size', "" head that's large compared body"", ""

Signs and symptoms of scrotal masses vary depending on the abnormality. Signs and symptoms might include:  An unusual lump   Sudden pain   A dull aching pain or feeling of heaviness in the scrotum   Pain that radiates throughout the groin, abdomen or lower back   Tender, swollen or hardened testicle   Tender, swollen or hardened epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss), the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm   Swelling in the scrotum   Redness of the skin of the scrotum   Nausea or vomiting   If the cause of a scrotal mass is an infection, signs and symptoms also might include: Fever   Urinary frequency   Pus or blood in the urine  When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you develop sudden pain in your scrotum. Some conditions require prompt treatment to avoid permanent damage to a testicle. See your doctor if you detect a lump in your scrotum, even if it's not painful or tender, or if you experience other symptoms of a scrotal mass. Some scrotal masses are more common in children. See your doctor if your child experiences symptoms of a scrotal mass, if you have any concerns about the development of the genitals or if a testicle is “missing” — an undescended or retractile testicle, which might increase the risk of some scrotal masses later in life.","['           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '               male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '        close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '     close    close  close male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '  male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' signs symptoms scrotal masses vary depending abnormality', ' signs symptoms include:  unusual lump   sudden pain   dull aching pain feeling heaviness scrotum   pain radiates groin', ' abdomen lower back   tender', ' swollen hardened testicle   tender', ' swollen hardened epididymis (ep-ih-did-uh-miss)', ' soft', ' comma-shaped tube testicle stores transports sperm   swelling scrotum   redness skin scrotum   nausea vomiting   cause scrotal mass infection', ' signs symptoms include: fever   urinary frequency   pus blood urine  see doctor seek emergency medical care develop sudden pain scrotum', ' conditions require prompt treatment avoid permanent damage testicle', ' see doctor detect lump scrotum', "" it's painful tender"", ' experience symptoms scrotal mass', ' scrotal masses common children', ' see doctor child experiences symptoms scrotal mass', ' concerns development genitals testicle “missing” — undescended retractile testicle', ' increase risk scrotal masses later life']"

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include:  Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasms Swelling Muscle weakness  When to see the doctor Mild strains can be treated at home. See a doctor if your symptoms worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable, or you experience numbness or tingling. Causes Acute strains can be caused by one event, such as using poor body mechanics to lift something heavy. Chronic muscle strains can result from repetitive injuries when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over. Risk factors Participating in contact sports — such as soccer, football, hockey, boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains. Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports. Examples include:  Legs and ankles. Sports that feature quick starts and jumping, such as hurdling and basketball, can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle. Hands. Gripping sports, such as gymnastics or golf, can increase your risk of muscle strains in your hands. Elbows. Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports.  Prevention Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport, fitness or work activity, as part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains. Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries.

It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:  Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.","['           male-pattern baldness       open pop-up dialog box          close    male-pattern baldness   male-pattern

Women may also have symptoms such as:  Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back Nausea Shortness of breath Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure Stomach (abdominal) pain","['           heart attack       open pop-up dialog box          close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '               heart attack       open pop-up dialog box           heart attack       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '          close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '        close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '     close    close  close heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '  heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", ' heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", ' angina symptoms include chest pain discomfort', ' chest pain discomfort may feel like:  burning fullness pressure squeezing  pain may felt arms', ' neck', ' jaw', ' shoulder back', '  symptoms angina include:  dizziness fatigue nausea shortness breath sweating  severity', ' duration type angina can vary', ' new symptoms may signal dangerous form angina (unstable angina) heart attack', ' new worsening angina symptoms need evaluated health care provider who can determine stable unstable angina', ' angina women symptoms angina women can classic angina symptoms', ' differences may lead delays seeking treatment', ' example', ' chest pain common symptom women angina', ' may only symptom prevalent symptom women', ' women may symptoms as:  discomfort neck', ' jaw', ' teeth back nausea shortness breath stabbing pain chest pressure stomach (abdominal) pain ']"

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture. Mild fractures might be mistaken for sprains or bruises. More-severe greenstick fractures may cause an obvious deformity, accompanied by significant pain and swelling. When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child has persistent pain in an injured limb. Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain, deformity and swelling. Causes Childhood fractures most commonly occur with a fall. Arm fractures are more common than leg fractures, since the common reaction is to throw out your arms to catch yourself when you fall. Risk factors The risk of greenstick fractures is higher in young children because their bones are softer and more flexible than adult bones. In a greenstick fracture, the bone bends and cracks instead of breaking into separate pieces. Most greenstick fractures occur in children under age 10.

"Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include:  Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss  Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:  Inflammation — follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.  All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood.","['signs symptoms trachoma affect eyes may include:  mild itching irritation eyes eyelids eye discharge containing mucus pus eyelid swelling light sensitivity (photophobia) eye pain eye redness vision loss  young children susceptible infection', ' disease progresses slowly', ' painful symptoms may emerge adulthood', '  world health organization (who) identified stages development trachoma:  inflammation — follicular', ' early infection follicles — small bumps contain lymphocytes', ' type white blood cell — visible magnification inner surface upper eyelid (conjunctiva)', ' inflammation — intense', ' stage', ' eye now highly infectious irritated', ' thickening swelling upper eyelid', ' eyelid scarring', ' repeated infections lead scarring inner eyelid', ' scars white lines examined magnification', ' eyelid may distorted may turn (entropion)', ' in-turned eyelashes (trichiasis)', ' scarred inner lining eyelid continues deform', ' causing lashes turn rub scratch transparent outer surface eye (cornea)', ' corneal clouding (opacity)', ' cornea affected inflammation commonly seen upper lid', ' continuous inflammation compounded scratching in-turned lashes leads clouding cornea', '  signs trachoma severe upper lid lower lid', ' intervention', ' disease process begins childhood can continue advance adulthood']"

"Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include:  Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements  Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include:  Cerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia). This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs.  Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction in males. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer.   Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma).  Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a ""bag of worms,"" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing.","['signs symptoms paraneoplastic syndromes nervous system can develop quickly', ' days weeks', ' signs symptoms paraneoplastic syndromes nervous system begin cancer diagnosed', ' signs symptoms vary depending body part being injured', ' may include:  difficulty walking difficulty maintaining balance loss muscle coordination loss muscle tone weakness loss fine motor skills', ' picking objects difficulty swallowing slurred speech stuttering memory loss thinking (cognitive) impairment vision problems sleep disturbances seizures hallucinations unusual involuntary movements  types paraneoplastic syndromes examples paraneoplastic syndromes nervous system include:  cerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia)', ' loss nerve cells area brain controls muscle functions balance (cerebellum)', ' signs symptoms may include unsteady impaired walking', ' lack muscle coordination limbs', ' inability maintain trunk posture', ' dizziness', ' nausea', ' involuntary eye movement', ' double vision', ' difficulty speaking', ' difficulty swallowing', ' limbic encephalitis', ' inflammation affecting region brain known limbic system', ' controls emotions', ' behaviors memory functions', ' people disorder may experience personality changes mood disturbances', ' memory loss', ' seizures', ' hallucinations', ' drowsiness', ' encephalomyelitis', ' syndrome refers inflammation brain spinal cord', ' may wide variety symptoms signs depending area affected', ' opsoclonus-myoclonus', ' syndrome due dysfunction cerebellum connections', ' can cause rapid', ' irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) involuntary', ' chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) limbs trunk', ' stiff person syndrome', ' previously called stiff man syndrome', ' syndrome characterized progressive', ' severe muscle stiffness rigidity', ' mainly affecting spine legs', ' may cause painful muscle spasms', ' myelopathy', ' term refers syndrome injury limited spinal cord', ' depending level spinal cord injury', ' may changes bowel bladder function', ' severe weakness numbness level body', ' level injury includes neck', ' can severe disability affecting limbs', '  lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome', ' syndrome caused disrupted communication nerves muscles', ' signs symptoms include pelvic lower extremity muscle weakness', ' fatigue', ' difficulty swallowing', ' difficulty speaking', ' irregular eye movement', ' double vision', ' autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth erectile dysfunction males', ' occurs paraneoplastic syndrome', ' lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome typically associated lung cancer', '   myasthenia gravis', ' myasthenia gravis disrupted communication nerves muscles characterized weakness rapid fatigue muscles voluntary control', ' including muscles face', ' eyes', ' arms legs', ' muscles involved chewing', ' swallowing', ' talking breathing may affected well', ' myasthenia gravis occurs paraneoplastic syndrome', ' typically associated cancer thymus gland (thymoma)', '  neuromyotonia', "" neuromyotonia — known isaacs' syndrome — characterized abnormal impulses nerve cells brain spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) control muscle movement"", ' impulses can cause twitching', ' muscle rippling looks like ""bag worms', '"" progressive stiffness', ' muscle cramps', ' slowed movement muscle impairments', ' peripheral neuropathy', ' condition refers patterns damage nerves transmit messages brain spinal column rest body', ' damage involves only sensory nerves peripheral nervous system', ' can pain disturbances sensation body', ' dysautonomia', ' dysautonomia refers wide range signs symptoms resulting injury nerves regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system)', ' heart rate', ' blood pressure', ' sweating', ' bowel bladder functions', ' part nervous system affected', ' common symptoms low blood pressure', ' irregular heartbeats trouble breathing', ' ']"

"Early in chronic kidney disease, you might have no signs or symptoms.

Because your kidneys can make up for lost function, signs and symptoms might not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. When to seek care Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your care provider is likely to monitor your kidney function with urine and blood tests and your blood pressure during regular office visits.

"Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including:  Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming  Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus. If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus).","['tinnitus ringing ears', ' external sound present', ' however', ' tinnitus can cause types phantom noises ears', ' including:  buzzing roaring clicking hissing humming  people who tinnitus subjective tinnitus', ' tinnitus only can hear', ' noises tinnitus may vary pitch low roar high squeal', ' may hear ears', ' cases', ' sound can loud interferes ability concentrate hear external sound', ' tinnitus may present time', ' may come go', ' rare cases', ' tinnitus can occur rhythmic pulsing whooshing sound', ' time heartbeat', ' called pulsatile tinnitus', ' pulsatile tinnitus', ' doctor may able hear tinnitus examination (objective tinnitus)']"

"Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can:  Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them. Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office.  At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can:  Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection.

But, there's no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Instead, you are probably experiencing delayed ejaculation if the delay is causing distress or frustration, or if you have to stop sexual activity due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection or a request from your partner. Often, men might have difficulty reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some men can ejaculate only when masturbating. Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms:  Lifelong vs. acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning. Generalized vs. situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation. Situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances.  These categories help in diagnosing an underlying cause and determining what might be the most effective treatment.","['men delayed ejaculation need 30 minutes sexual stimulation orgasm ejaculate', ' men able ejaculate (anejaculation)', ' but', "" there's specific time diagnosis delayed ejaculation"", ' instead', ' experiencing delayed ejaculation delay causing distress frustration', ' sexual activity due fatigue', ' physical irritation', ' loss erection request partner', ' often', ' men difficulty reaching orgasm sexual intercourse sexual activities partner', ' men can ejaculate only masturbating', ' delayed ejaculation divided following types based symptoms:  lifelong vs', ' acquired', ' lifelong delayed ejaculation', ' problem present time sexual maturity', ' acquired delayed ejaculation occurs period normal sexual functioning', ' generalized vs', ' situational', "" generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited sex partners kinds stimulation"", ' situational delayed ejaculation occurs only circumstances', '  categories help diagnosing underlying cause determining effective treatment']"
"Some people carry C. difficile bacteria in their intestines but never become sick. These individuals are carriers of the bacteria and may spread infections. Signs and symptoms usually develop within 5 to 10 days after starting a course of antibiotics. However, they may occur as soon as the first day or up to three months later. Mild to moderate infection The most common signs and symptoms of mild to moderate C. difficile infection are:  Watery diarrhea three or more times a day for more than one day Mild abdominal cramping and tenderness  Severe infection People who have a severe C. difficile infection tend to become dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized. C. difficile can cause the colon to become inflamed and sometimes form patches of raw tissue that can bleed or produce pus. Signs and symptoms of severe infection include:  Watery diarrhea as often as 10 to 15 times a day Abdominal cramping and pain, which may be severe Rapid heart rate Dehydration Fever Nausea Increased white blood cell count Kidney failure Loss of appetite Swollen abdomen Weight loss Blood or pus in the stool  C. difficile infection that is severe and sudden, an uncommon condition, may also cause intestinal inflammation leading to enlargement of the colon (also called toxic megacolon) and sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. People who have these conditions are admitted to the intensive care unit.","['people carry c', ' difficile bacteria intestines sick', ' individuals carriers bacteria may spread infections', ' signs symptoms develop 5 10 days starting course antibiotics', ' however', ' may occur soon first day months later', ' mild moderate infection common signs symptoms mild moderate c', ' difficile infection are:  watery diarrhea times day day mild abdominal cramping tenderness  severe infection people who severe c', ' difficile infection tend dehydrated may need hospitalized', ' c', ' difficile can cause colon inflamed form patches raw tissue can bleed produce pus', ' signs symptoms severe infection include:  watery diarrhea 10 15 times day abdominal cramping pain', ' may severe rapid heart rate dehydration fever nausea increased white blood cell count kidney failure loss appetite swollen abdomen weight loss blood pus stool  c', ' difficile infection severe sudden', ' uncommon condition', ' may cause intestinal inflammation leading enlargement colon (also called toxic megacolon) sepsis', "" sepsis life-threatening condition occurs body's response infection damages tissues"", ' people who conditions admitted intensive care unit']"

AVM Research hasn't found that pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhage for people with a brain AVM. However, more research needs to be done. AVM One severe type of brain AVM involves the vein of Galen. It causes signs and symptoms that emerge soon or immediately after birth.

"Babies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child. The main signs and symptoms include:  Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body. Loss of movement and coordination abilities. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Unusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.  Other signs and symptoms can include:  Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Intellectual disabilities. Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.  Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:  Stage 1: Early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age. Stage 1 can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage 2: Rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage 3: Plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with less crying and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage 4: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often.","['babies rett syndrome born uncomplicated pregnancy delivery', ' infants rett syndrome grow behave expected first months', ' that', ' signs symptoms start appear', ' pronounced changes generally occur 12 18 months age', ' period weeks months', ' symptoms severity vary greatly child child', ' signs symptoms include:  slowed growth', ' brain growth slows birth', ' smaller usual head size (microcephaly) first sign child rett syndrome', ' children older', ' delayed growth parts body', ' loss movement coordination abilities', ' first signs include reduced hand control decreasing ability crawl walk', ' first', ' loss abilities occurs rapidly', ' continues gradually', ' eventually muscles weak stiff', ' unusual movement positioning', ' loss communication abilities', ' children rett syndrome typically begin lose ability speak', ' eye contact communicate ways', ' may disinterested people', ' toys surroundings', ' children rapid changes', ' sudden loss language', ' time', ' children may gradually regain eye contact develop nonverbal communication skills', ' unusual hand movements', ' children rett syndrome develop repetitive', ' purposeless hand movements', ' differ child child', ' hand movements may include hand-wringing', ' squeezing', ' clapping', ' tapping rubbing', '  signs symptoms can include:  unusual eye movements', ' children rett syndrome tend unusual eye movements', ' intense staring', ' blinking', ' crossed eyes closing eye time', ' breathing problems', ' include breath holding', ' rapid breathing (hyperventilation)', ' forcefully blowing air saliva', ' swallowing air', ' problems tend occur waking hours', ' breathing disturbances shallow breathing short periods stopping breathing (apnea) can occur sleep', ' irritability crying', ' children rett syndrome may increasingly agitated irritable older', ' periods crying screaming may begin suddenly', ' apparent reason', ' last hours', ' children may experience fears anxiety', ' unusual behaviors', ' may include', ' example', ' sudden', ' odd facial expressions long bouts laughter', ' hand licking', ' grasping hair clothing', ' intellectual disabilities', ' loss skills may connected losing ability think', ' understand learn', ' seizures', ' people who rett syndrome experience seizures time lives', ' multiple seizure types may occur associated changes electroencephalogram (eeg)', ' sideways curvature spine (scoliosis)', ' scoliosis common rett syndrome', ' typically begins 8 11 years age progresses age', ' surgery may required curvature severe', ' irregular heartbeat', ' life-threatening problem children adults rett syndrome can result sudden death', ' sleep disturbances', ' problems sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times', ' falling asleep day being awake night', ' waking night crying screaming', ' symptoms', ' variety symptoms can occur', ' decreased response pain; small hands feet cold; problems chewing swallowing; problems bowel function; teeth grinding', '  stages rett syndrome rett syndrome commonly divided stages:  stage 1: early onset', ' signs symptoms subtle easily overlooked first stage', ' starts 6 18 months age', ' stage 1 can last months year', ' babies stage may show eye contact start lose interest toys', ' may delays sitting crawling', ' stage 2: rapid deterioration', ' starting 1 4 years age', ' children lose ability perform skills previously had', ' loss can rapid gradual', ' occurring weeks months', ' symptoms rett syndrome occur', ' slowed head growth', ' abnormal hand movements', ' hyperventilating', ' screaming crying apparent reason', ' problems movement coordination', ' loss social interaction communication', ' stage 3: plateau', ' third stage begins ages 2 10 years', ' can last years', ' problems movement continue', ' behavior may slightly improve', ' crying irritability', ' may improvement hand communication', "" seizures may begin stage generally don't occur age 2"", ' stage 4: late motor deterioration', ' stage begins age 10 can last years decades', "" it's marked reduced mobility"", ' muscle weakness', ' joint contractures scoliosis', ' understanding', ' communication hand skills generally remain stable improve slightly', ' seizures may occur often', ' ']"

"Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include twitching or contracting of muscles in the face that are usually:  On one side of the face Uncontrollable Painless  These contractions often start in the eyelid, then may progress and affect the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. But eventually, usually over the course of several months to a few years, they occur almost constantly. Occasionally, hemifacial spasms may occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time. Causes Hemifacial spasm is most often caused by a blood vessel touching a facial nerve. It can also be caused by a facial nerve injury or a tumor. Sometimes there's no identifiable cause. Hemifacial spasm may sometimes be triggered by:  Moving the muscles in the face Anxiety Stress Fatigue                   By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff  Hemifacial spasm care at Mayo Clinic","['common symptoms hemifacial spasm include twitching contracting muscles face usually:  side face uncontrollable painless  contractions start eyelid', ' may progress affect cheek mouth side face', ' first', ' hemifacial spasms come go', ' eventually', ' course months years', ' occur constantly', ' occasionally', ' hemifacial spasms may occur sides face', ' however', "" twitching doesn't occur sides face time"", ' causes hemifacial spasm caused blood vessel touching facial nerve', ' can caused facial nerve injury tumor', "" there's identifiable cause"", ' hemifacial spasm may triggered by:  moving muscles face anxiety stress fatigue                   mayo clinic staff mayo clinic staff  hemifacial spasm care mayo clinic ']"

"Signs and symptoms of calciphylaxis include:  Large purple net-like patterns on skin Deep, very painful lumps that ulcerate creating open sores with black-brown crust that fails to heal — typically in skin areas with high fat content, such as the stomach and thigh, although they can occur anywhere Infections from wounds that don't heal  Causes The exact cause of calciphylaxis is unknown, but recent studies have revealed that most people with the condition have abnormalities in blood-clotting factors. Blood-clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding. These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would. In addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium. This causes calcium to be deposited in the smallest parts of the arteries (arterioles), which eventually leads to the formation of blood clots in the arterioles. Blood clots can cause fat tissues and skin to be deprived of oxygen and nourishment.","['signs symptoms calciphylaxis include:  large purple net-like patterns skin deep', ' painful lumps ulcerate creating open sores black-brown crust fails heal — typically skin areas high fat content', ' stomach thigh', "" can occur infections wounds don't heal  causes exact cause calciphylaxis unknown"", ' recent studies revealed people condition abnormalities blood-clotting factors', ' blood-clotting factors substances blood help bleeding', ' abnormalities can lead small blood clots forming normally would', ' addition', ' people calciphylaxis imbalance metabolism calcium', ' causes calcium deposited smallest parts arteries (arterioles)', ' eventually leads formation blood clots arterioles', ' blood clots can cause fat tissues skin deprived oxygen nourishment']"
